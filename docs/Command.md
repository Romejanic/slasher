# Command
`Command` is an alias type for [CommandInteraction](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/CommandInteraction). It does not contain any additional properties or methods, so any reference for its API should come from the discord.js docs.

While it has its own methods for replying, deferring and editing the responses, you should preferably use the [CommandContext](./CommandContext.md) object to perform these actions.
