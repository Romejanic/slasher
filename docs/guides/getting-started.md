# Getting started
Welcome! You're on your way to creating your first Discord bot with Slasher!

Let's start with a little bit about what to expect:

* Slasher is mainly two things: a command line tool and a library
* Slasher is an *abstraction layer* which sits on top of discord.js, it is **NOT** a replacement for discord.js
* You should still have a thorough knowledge of discord.js and how to use it. In fact, knowledge of how to use slash commands with vanilla discord.js would be preferable (maybe to increase appreciation for Slasher :P)
* At the time of writing, this package is a beta at the most. It is still fairly early in development, and you may encounter bugs or other unexpected behaviour. If anything happens, please [report it](https://github.com/Romejanic/slasher/issues/new/choose) so this package can become as awesome as possible :D
